## Instructions
- **Refactoring Philosophy**: Always try to refactor for modularity, but do not over-refactor. Ensure the ability to scale is preserved and modularity is maintained without adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Work Log**: Always update `work_log.md` after completing a task. Maintain the existing table format (`| Date | Time | Feature | Description |`). Import content from old logs if found.
